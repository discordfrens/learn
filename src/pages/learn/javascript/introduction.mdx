You've _probably_ heard of JavaScript before if you've dabbled with HTML & CSS, so lets start by explaining what exactly JavaScript is and how it's used.

### What is JavaScript?

avaScript is a programming language designed to make websites more interactive. In the past, JavaScript could only be executed in the browser but now it can run on the server thanks to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of the web works
- Basic knowledge of HTML
- Basic knowledge of CSS

### Important

When learning a new programming language sometimes it can be very tempting to jump onto trendy languages like Golang or Rust but we recommend you stick with JavaScript for now since JavaScript has such a large ecosystem so getting help or solutions to your problem should be easy.
