## Basics - Hello world

Intalizing a go project is as simple as a single command. `go mod init <name>/main` for this example we will be using `hello/main`.
Create a file called `main.go` within your root directory.

```go
// Supply a package name, main for the main.go file
package main;

// Import the "standard libary" aka FMT, which supplies formatted I/O
// with functions simular to C's printf and scanf
import (
  "fmt"
)

// Initalize your main function, this will be ran when the go file is ran.
func main() {
  // Print out "Hello world"
  fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
```

too run your go project either run `go run main.go` or if you wish to you can build it then run the executable. `go build .`

## External Imports

if you wish to use a go package you will import then using their name or supplied github repo.

```go
// ...

import (
  "fmt"
  "log" // https://pkg.go.dev/log
  "io" // https://pkg.go.dev/io
)

// ...
```

How ever if you wish to install internal files then please continue reading. For this example we will be creating a functions file.
Please create a `utils/funcs.go` directory + file within your root directory; here is some example code for your `funcs.go` file.

```go
package funcs

import (
  "fmt"
)
// To export a function it must start with a capital letter
func Print(message string) {
  fmt.Println(messsage)
}
```

Now to call this function inside of your `main.go` file you will use the following import statment

```go
package main

import (
  funcs "hello/main/utils"
)

// Usage
func main() {
 funcs.Print("Hello world") // Outputs "Hello world"
}
```
