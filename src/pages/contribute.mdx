Learn is mangaged and maintained by [discordfrens](https://github.com/discordfrens) and its community. Having learn open sourced allows **you** to be able to contribute to this free resource book. Examples on how learn is layed out can be found below or you can see them in the [GitHub repo.](https://github.com/discordfrens/resources)

The directory `learn` should follow this simple format.

<div class="flex row gap-2 w-full">
  ![File
  structure](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1039957808247996448/1045754382391726110/image.png)
  <div class="flex flex-col">
    <p>`learn/[category]/index.astro`</p>
    <p>`learn/[category]/[topic].mdx`</p>
  </div>
</div>

Your `index.astro` file should contain the following content and nothing else.

```astro
---
import BaseLayout from "../../../layouts/BaseLayout.astro";
import RenderAllContent from "../../../components/RenderAllContent.astro";
const category = "CATEGORY"
---

<BaseLayout category={category}>
  <RenderAllContent category={category}/>
</BaseLayout>
```

Your `[topic].mdx` files should contain the following boilerplate content.

```mdx
---
name: "Name"
category: "THE CATEGORY IT IS IN"
layout: "../../../layouts/MDXLayout.astro"
---

The content....
```
